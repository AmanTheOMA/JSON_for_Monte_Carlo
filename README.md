# JSON_promps_for_Monte_Carlo
Here is the follwoing I want you to do:
1. Create a free account on Hey Gen.
2. Go to this endpoint: https://app.heygen.com/home
3. Copy the JSON prompt from the correct file and paste it in the content area.
4. Make sure time is 60 seconds and video type is horizontal (Landscape).
5. Press enter. It will double check with you to see if what you are looking for is correctly written/prompt or not, write "yes"
6. That's it!
