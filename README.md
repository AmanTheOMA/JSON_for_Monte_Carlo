# JSON_promps_for_Monte_Carlo
Here is the follwoing I want you to do:
1. Create a free account on Hey Gen.
2. Go to this endpoint: https://app.heygen.com/home
3. Copy each part of the JSON prompt from the correct file and paste it in the content area. Notice that there are 3 parts to each videos. Each is 1 minute. So, total is 3 minutes. Our wonderful editor will add the 3 videos together to form a uniformed video from each file. 
4. Make sure time is 60 seconds and video type is horizontal (Landscape).
5. Press enter. It will double check with you to see if what you are looking for is correctly written/prompt or not, write "yes"
6. That's it! Now, wait for it to make the video and copy the link of the video and paste it in our "Scripts" docs.
